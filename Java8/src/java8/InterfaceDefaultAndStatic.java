/**
 * what is default & static methods
 *  - from java 8 we have a support of Interface methods can also have implementation.
 *  - default methods - enables to add new functionality and provides backward compatability to the old libraries.
 *  - Static mehtods , This enables to organize helper methods.
 * why we need default and static?
 *  - Default methods enable you to add new functionality to the interfaces
 *         of your libraries and ensure binary compatibility with code written 
           for older versions of those interfaces.
 * - Static Methods: This makes it easier for you to organize helper methods in your libraries; 
 *    you can keep static methods specific to an interface in the same interface rather than in a separate class
 * how we can implement?
 *  - all default,static methods are implicitly public
 *  -
